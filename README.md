===============
This is an example project used to learn more about iOS Development. This includes learning about how certain concepts work in Objective-C such as OOP, MVC, data structures, storyboards, actions, etc.

Although not fully fleshed out game, this was an excellent introduction to iOS Development.

Notes for the future:
- How should code be organized better?
- How can I refactor for more robust code?
- How do I implement testing?
